This application is build using MATLAB R2024b. It is used for the evaluation of Thermoelectric Properties of PbTe nanaoparticle.It uses four input parameters namely Barrier Height which will be in a particular range, other parameters include the barrier width which will be in units of cm, next we have is the temperature and the carrier concentration.
In order to get the TE properties w.r.t barrier heigh, the other three input parameters need to be constant(e.g Barrier Width-12e-7,Temp-300,Carrier Conc:5e21).
The user can get the TE properties at a particular temperature and at the next interface users can plot or export the desired reults.
Users can also vary the temperature keeping the first window open and just vary the temperature and move to the next window and can export to the same excel file but gets same in different sheets.
It gives the optimized value of barrier height that maximizes zT as a function of temperature, gives efficiency as a function of barrier height. The peak of this curve gives the optimized value of Barrier Height, which maximizes efficiency. (d) The dotted line gives the maximized zT values, zTmax,that can be achieved through filtering, as a function of temperature. The zTmax values are obtained by filtering through Uopt values shown in
